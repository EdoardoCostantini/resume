		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textit{Academic research}: I developed cutting-edge algorithms to address non-response bias in questionnaires
			\item \textit{Educational material development}: I designed material for university students to practice and evaluate their computational and statistical skills. I developed a website to share accessible study material based on my research (see my personal website).
			\item \textit{Teaching}: I thought university master students how to program in R and perform complex data analyses in R. I recorded video tutorials to help students understand the programming language R.
			\item \textit{Coordination}: I managed small groups of teaching assistants for multiple iterations of the main statistics course in a data science master program

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Research software development} | I developed an R package to estimate a special type of principal component analysis 
        (\href{https://github.com/EdoardoCostantini/gspcr}{gspcr}). I contributed to the development of a variety of R packages in the field of social science (e.g., \href{https://github.com/amices/mice/pull/438}{mice}, \href{https://github.com/MicheleNuijten/statcheck}{statcheck}). I developed numerous web applications to facilitate interaction with research results.
        \item \textbf{Academic research} | I developed cutting-edge algorithms to address non-response bias in social surveys.
        \item \textbf{Development of educational material} | I designed tutorials and study material for university students to practice and evaluate their computational and statistical skills. I developed a website to share accessible blog posts on statistical concepts (see the `Digital garden` on my personal website).
        \item \textbf{Frontal teaching} | I taught university master students how to program and perform complex data analyses in R. I recorded instructional videos to facilitate hybrid learning.
